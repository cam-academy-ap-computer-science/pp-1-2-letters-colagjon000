Good work!  Your program is very clean and well-organized.

You had a strange double-quote at the beginning of your
ending paragraph.  I'm not sure what was intended there, but
it didn't match up with anything, so I took one point off for
that.

For future projects, you will want to start adding comments.
Everybody does comments slightly differently, but at a minimum
it would have been good to have a comment for the methods that
were letters and the methods that were shared paragraphs.  You
did have some descriptive comments identifying your different
types of friends, but comments that show the overall structure
of your code can be really helpful, as well.
